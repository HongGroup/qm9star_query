# Download and deploy QM9*

QM9* is a reactive intermidiate dataset, which is an extension of the QM9 dataset containing more than 2,000,000 molecular structures. This tutorial shows how to download and deploy the QM9* dataset. Our raw data dumps are available at [figshare](). You can download the data dumps from the link above.

## Install the environment

The dumps are PostgreSQL dumps. To use them, you need to install PostgreSQL (we recommend version 16) with pgvector extension, and a client to connect to it (we recommend pgadmin4). You can run PostgreSQL by Docker following the code below:

```bash
```

## Restore the dumps
